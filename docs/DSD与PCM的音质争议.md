# DSD 与 PCM 的音质争议



# DOES DSD SOUND WORSE THAN PCM?

Not necessarily. The problem with DSD is that you cannot edit, mix, or master it because there’s no proprietary software to do any of these things.

DSD also uses extremely high levels of noise shaping, meaning that at lower frequencies (those we can hear) the noise is very low, but once you get into ultrasonic frequencies the noise level rises extremely quickly.[^1]
